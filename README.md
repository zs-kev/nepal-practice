# nepal-practice

A very simple website that I created just to test some of my newly learnt skills.
The website dosent have a function and there was no UX thought put into it, I just wanted to be able to see my progress in HTML and CSS.

There is a little bit of flexbox in there, but it dosent work as well I would like as at the time of making this site
I had not learnt flexbox yet, so what flexbox is currently there is a mix of information I gathered from videos and forums. 
Once I have mastered it though, I will come back to this site and clean in it up.
