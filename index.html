            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Nepal is a nation between India and Tibet known for its temples and Himalayan mountains, which include Mt. Everest. Kathmandu, the capital, has a mazelike old quarter filled with Hindu and Buddhist shrines. Around Kathmandu Valley are Swayambhunath, a Buddhist temple with resident monkeys; Boudhanath, a massive Buddhist stupa; Hindu temples and cremation grounds at Pashupatinath; and the medieval city of Bhaktapur.</p>

                <p>If a glimpse of true Nepalese culture and family life is what you’re after, then there’s nothing like spending a night in a homestay. For between USD $5-$30 a night, you’ll have a basic but comfortable room and the chance to immerse yourself in the day-to-day lives of your host family. Many homestays also offer guided tours, meditiation, and (best of all) authentic home-cooked Nepalese food.</p>

Each community holds their unique cultures and traditions which they have been following for centuries. Each of them has their own set of beliefs and festivals to celebrate.</p>

            <p>If you’re worried about going without a bed in Nepal, don’t be - there are accommodation options literally everywhere. Established tourist centres offer the greatest variety, including Kathmandu, Pokhara and Chitwan, where you’ll find everything from glamorous 5-star to questionably basic.
                Up in the mountains, including Everest Base Camp and the Annapurna Circuit, you'll mostly find pretty basic teahouses and trekking lodges. Further afar, teahouses, home-stays and guesthouses exist the most off the beaten track areas. </p>
